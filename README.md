# CS350-ModuleEight
# 1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The objective of this project addressed utilizing a single byte stored in a serial buffer. Characters were repeatedly processed using a switch/case construct, facilitating terminal enter input 'on' or 'off'. The input controlled the LEDs  on the board, with the specific LEDs  being activated or deactivated depending on whether 'on' or 'off' was entered.
# 2. What did you do particularly well?
I feel that my structure for this assignment was extremely encapsulated and allowed for my code to stay organized. I did have to reorganize my outline a few times, but I feel very proud of how my projects turned out.
# 3. Where could you improve?
I do feel that my issue related to this project was the lack of understanding of the software. For future circumstances, I should become more equipped with software and devices before committing to extensive projects.
# 4. What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
During this course, Iâ€™ve gained additional proficiency in CCS and added programming in an MCU. Before this class, I had no experience with MCUs, so there was a significant learning curve. This experience, coupled with prior course projects, will serve as valuable references in the future for both my educational endeavors and in my path towards my career.
# 5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
During this project, I gained knowledge of working with MCUs as well as adding to my proficiency in CSS and other OOP principles. I know future courses will build on this, but I am hoping to work on embedded systems in vehicles if given the opportunity. 
# 6. How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I strive to maintain cleanliness and clarity in my code, making it easily comprehensible. Adjustments to the necessary end product can be made with ease by adding or removing cases in the switch statement to maintain adaptability.
